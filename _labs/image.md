In this lab we will be exploring the utility of data manipulation in a practical application by editing an image in C. **This lab will be programming heavy** and a little more involved than previous labs. **Make sure you allow yourself enough time to complete this lab.**

### Bitmap Struct

Unlike other programming languages that you may be familiar with, the C programming language is not an object oriented programming language. This means that there are no `class` objects that allow you to associate groups of data together.

To accomplish this, C uses a `struct` data structure, which is actually a predecessor to the `class` object we see in most programs. Below is the `struct` included in the `image.h` library in the code for this lab:

```c
typedef struct
{
    FILE * img;
    uint8_t file_header[BMP_FILE_HEADER_SIZE];  // 14 bytes
    uint8_t * dib_header;                       // Variable
    uint8_t * pxl_data;                         // Pixel data for image
    uint8_t * pxl_data_cpy;                     // Copy of pixel data
    uint8_t pxl_data_offset;                    // Location of pxl data in img
    uint32_t img_width;                         // Image width
    uint32_t img_height;                        // Image height
    uint32_t file_size;                         // Size of the file
    uint32_t pxl_data_size;                     // Size of pixel data array
} Bitmap;
```

Much like a `class`, a `struct` is a collection of different variable values all associated together. In the `Bitmap struct` we see many properties associated with the file, including:

- `pxl_data`: This is a one dimensional list of `uint8_t` values that represent pixel values in the image.
- `pxl_data_cpy`: This is a copy of the list of `uint8_t` values that represent pixel values in the image. This will be helpful with some of the algorithms later on in the lab.
- `img_width`: Number of pixels in each row in the image.
- `img_height`: Number of rows of pixels in the image.
- `pxl_data_size`: Size (in bytes) of `pxl_data`.

To access members of the `struct`, you use the dot operator or the arrow operator, depending on if the `struct` is a pointer or not. For example:

```c
Bitmap image;
printf("width: %u, height: %u\n", image.image_width, image.image_height);

Bitmap* image;
printf("width: %u, height: %u\n", image->image_width, image->image_height);
```

In this example, to access the width and height of a `struct`, we used the dot symbol. However, if we have pointer to a `struct`, we must dereference the pointer first before accessing the member. This can be done using `(*image).image_width`, but this is such a common operation to do that C added special syntax for it, the arrow operator, `->`.


### Bitmasking
Bitmasking is a method that allows us to manipulate certain bits of data (e.g., set a bit to 1 or 0). This is done general by making use of bitwise ORs, ANDs, and XORs.

For example if we wanted to select nothing but the last two bits of the byte (in binary) `11101011` we would use AND with a 0 on all the values we don't want and a 1 on all the values we do want in our selection:

```
     11101011
AND  00000011   <--- This value is known as the 'mask'
-------------
     00000011   <--- The masked value
```
Although this is most obvious when representing the numbers as binary, the masking principles work for any representation of numbers.

If we wanted to recreate the following operation in C with hexademical numbers, it would be the following:

```c
uint8_t number = 0xEB;
uint8_t mask   = 0x03;

// Mask the numbers
number = number & mask; // number = 0x03
```

### Pixel Values in BMP file

Images are made out of many different colored points, called pixels, all put together in a two dimensional grid. Pixels are just one color and typically really small. To demonstrate the idea, I have broken the picture into a grid. While they are not the actual pixels of the image (they are much too small), hopefully it gets the idea across.

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 350px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/image_2d.png %}" alt="Units of the course.">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Images are visualized as a two dimensional grid of pixels.</figcaption>
</figure>

A computer doesn't necessarily store the image data in a two dimensional grid. It often stores it as a long list (called an array), where each row is concatenated with the previous row.

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/image_1d.png %}" alt="Units of the course.">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Images are stored as a one dimensional list.</figcaption>
</figure>

Within each pixel, the computer actually stores **three values for each pixel**: a red color, a blue color, and a green color. Different values of each color channels will provide different hues and shades of a pixel. If that isn't making too much sense, there is a wonderful visualization of how different color channels create different pixel colors [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp). Each color of a pixel is exactly 8 bits long (or one byte). In BMP files, the pixels are typically stored bottom-up, starting in the bottom left corner, moving left to right. This is helpful to know when you debug your program.

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 600px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/pixels.png %}">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Each pixel value is actually made up of 3 `uint8_t` values, representing blue, green, and red.</figcaption>
</figure>

Look at the `pxl_data` field in the `Bitmap` struct shown above. What type does it use? (Feel free to ignore the star). While creating the algorithms below, keep in mind that the values are stored as colors and **NOT pixels**. This means that pxl_data will be 3 times longer than the image size (as determined by multiplying the width and height of the image). There are many ways of accessing the individual colors of a pixel, but one way is to navigate to a specific pixel, and then access the individual color by adding an offset:

```c
uint8_t x = 10; // Randomly selected pixel number

uint8_t blue = pxl_data[x * 3];
uint8_t green = pxl_data[x * 3 + 1];
uint8_t red = pxl_data[x * 3 + 2];
```

If you want to access adjacent pixels, for example accessing the blue color, you will have to jump by three integer values:

```c
uint8_t x = 5; // Randomly selected pixel number

uint8_t blue = pxl_data[x * 3]; // Multiply by 3 because each pixel consists of BGR
uint8_t next_blue = pxl_data[(x + 1) * 3]; // Get the blue color for the next pixel
```

**Note:** In BMPs, the width of the image must be a multiple of 4 bytes. This means if the image has a width that is not a multiple of 4, the BMP file employs padding to fulfill that requirement. We have ensured that the picture you are working with is a multiple of 4 and you do not need to worry about dealing with padding for this lab. However, if you use your lab to read in different bmp files, it might not work.

## Requirements
In the code provided in this lab, you will be expected to edit the original image listed at the top of this page to provide some fun visual effects!

Much of the code has been given for you, but you are expected to follow the comments in the files and fill in logic for both the `remove_color_channel()` function and the `or_filter()` function.

### Remove Color Channel
In this function, you are expected to create logic that will allow a user to specify a color channel and have that color removed completely from the image. As you can see in the figures below, each image has either the red, green, or blue values set to 0.

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 750px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/red_mask.bmp %}" alt="Units of the course.">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Original.bmp with all of the red values masked out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 750px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/green_mask.bmp %}" alt="Units of the course.">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Original.bmp with all of the green values masked out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 750px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/blue_mask.bmp %}" alt="Units of the course.">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Original.bmp with all of the blue values masked out.</figcaption>
</figure>

These images are the answer to your function! If you have done it correctly, your output should look exactly like whats above.

### OR Filter

This function will be the culmination of your data manipulation knowledge that you have learned up until now. In this function you will take each color value of a pixel and bitwise OR it with the pixel color value directly above and below it. For example, if you are working on pixel x, you would OR the blue color with the blue color of the pixel above (top) and the pixel below (bottom). You would repeat this for the green and red colors. You would then move to the next pixel in your image.

<figure class="image mx-auto" style="max-width: 700px">
  <img src="{% link assets/image/or_filter.png %}">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">OR filter or's the color channels of the pixel above and below a specific pixel.</figcaption>
</figure>

 Remember, while visually the pixels are above and below each other, they are actually stored in a long array. As part of this lab, you must figure out how to access the vertically adjacent pixels in the one dimensional array. You will also have to deal with two special cases: when you are on the top row and the bottom row. In those two conditions, you won't be able to or filter like normal because you are missing an expected row.

Make sure to use the `pxl_data_cpy` list as your values that you are changing inside of your `pxl_data` list. If you use the `pxl_data` as your reference data, you will have compounding effects that will cause the image to be indistinguishable. This is not correct.

## Submission

- Answer the questions in the `README.md`.

- To pass off to a TA, you must show your "or filtered" image (or_filter.bmp) and explain what is causing the image's visual behavior.

- To successfully submit your lab, you will need to follow the instructions in the [Lab Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab-setup) page, especially the **Committing and Pushing Files** section.
