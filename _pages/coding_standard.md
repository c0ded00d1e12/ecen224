We decided to keep the coding standard simple so you can worry less about the standard and more about learning. The coding standard has the following requirements:

1. All code must be written in C.
  
2. You must use [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format your code with the following options: 

    - Open up VSCode and type in `Ctrl + ,`
    - In the search bar, type in `clang`
    - Under the section that says **C_Cpp: Clang_format_style**, enter in

      ```
      { BasedOnStyle: LLVM, UseTab: Never, IndentWidth: 4, TabWidth: 4, ColumnLimit: 100, InsertBraces: true }
      ```
    - Then type in `Format on save` in the search bar and check the box under **Format on Save**

3. For every function you write, have a block comment before it explaining what the function does.
